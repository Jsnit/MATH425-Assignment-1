# MATH425: Applied Stat Models: Assignment-1

1. Grade Point Average (KNNL Problem #1.19 on page 35): The director of admissions of
a small college selected 120 students at random from the new freshman class in a study
to determine whether a student's grade point average (GPA) at the end of the freshman
year (Y) can be predicted from the ACT test score (X). Assume that simple linear regression
is appropriate.
Using R, perform statistical operations on the dataset:

  a. Obtain the least squares estimates of ùõΩ0 and ùõΩ1, and state the estimated regression function.
  b. Plot the estimated regression function and the data. Does the estimated regression function appear to fit the data well?
  c. Obtain a point estimate of the mean freshman GPA for students with ACT test score X = 30.
  d. What is the point estimate of the change in the mean response when the entrance test score increases by one point?

3. Muscle Mass (KNNL Problem #1.27 on page 36): A person's muscle mass is expected to
decrease with age. To explore this relationship in women, a nutritionist randomly selected
15 women from each 10-year age group, beginning with age 40 and ending with age 79.
The results follow; X is age, and Y is a measure of muscle mass. Assume that first-order
regression model is appropriate.
Using R, perform statistical operations on the dataset:

  (a) Obtain the estimated regression function. Plot the estimated regression function and
      the data. Does a linear regression function appear to give a good fit here? Does your plot
      support the anticipation that muscle mass decreases with age?
   (b) Obtain the following:
       (1) a point estimate of the difference in the mean muscle mass for women differing in age by one year
       (2) a point estimate of the mean muscle mass for women aged X = 60 years,
       (3) the value of the residual for the eighth case,
       (4) a point estimate of ùúé2.
